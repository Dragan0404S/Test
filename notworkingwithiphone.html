Waleed1 There’s a global energy crisis and onshore wind farms are a potential growth option. Larger wind turbines produce more power than standard ones, but the components are too big to be transported by road.

What’s the solution? A Colorado-based energy startup named Radia has an idea. It’s developing the biggest aircraft in aviation history.

Meet the WindRunner airplane, whose mission will be Waleed2 to deliver gigantic 300-foot-long blades directly to wind farms.

To help the world meet its decarbonization targets, it’ll use sustainable aviation fuel and needs only a simple packed-dirt or gravel runway to land on.

It’ll operate from regional hubs, says Radia, delivering where needed – and “can land on airstrips as short as 6,000 feet (1,800 meters), something no other large commercial aircraft can achieve.”
Let’s talk about specs, baby
When it comes to carrying the largest payloads ever moved by air, dainty just isn’t going to cut it.

So WindRunner will have a cargo bay volume of 272,000 cubic feet, enough to hold three Olympic swimming pools. That’s 12 times the volume of a Boeing 747-400 and – at 356 feet in length, it’s 127 feet longer too.

As for the wingspan, that’s 261 feet – imagine four bowling lanes laid end to end. Waleed3

It will also dwarf the Antonov An-225, the heaviest aircraft ever built, which was destroyed at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The aircraft’s scale might be groundbreaking, but the engineering is not – and that’s by design. Radia says it’s focusing “on existing technology and safety by using, where applicable, tried-and-true aviation materials, components and fabrication techniques that have FAA [US Federal Aviation Administration] approval, are already in mass production and are lowest-risk.”

The idea is to hit the ground running with a fast, well-built fleet that meets aerospace industry standards. Online reports say commercial operations as soon as 2027, but there’s no timeline confirmed on Radia’s website. CNN has reached out to the company for comment.
There she blows
Radia is banking on research organisation Bloomberg NEF’s estimation that up to $10 trillion will be spent on onshore wind through 2050. The development of WindRunner is to enable GigaWind, the XXL turbines made by Radia’s partners, which include five of the world’s top six turbine manufacturers.

Currently, turbine blades today are ordinarily 230 feet or less (70 meters), but Radia wants to deploy blades of up to 104 meters (341 feet). The company says GigaWind turbines could potentially be two to three times more powerful – and two to three times more profitable than those typically deployed today.

So who are the folks behind these ambitious claims? The founder and CEO is Mark Lundstrum, a cross-industry entrepreneur and MIT aerospace engineer who founded Radia in 2016. The company says its team of advisers include former top brass from Boeing, MIT, Rolls-Royce and the FAA, as well as former US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull.

It’s an impressive lineup and the decision to focus on safe, existing technology is a smart one. Might we see a WindRunner take off before the end of the decade? Could its distinctive shape one day be as popular as the Beluga XL transporter planes created by Airbus?

 — 
Two years after a Boeing 737-800 passenger jet nosedived 29,000 feet into a remote mountain, killing all 132 people on board, investigators in China have failed to offer new insight into the cause of the country’s deadliest air disaster in decades.

In an update of its probe released Wednesday ahead of the crash anniversary, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) did not address the crucial question of what had prompted China Eastern flight 5735 to nosedive, nor did it mention data from the plane’s black boxes that would offer key clues to explain what happened.

Instead, its statement merely reiterated earlier findings that it found no problems with the aircraft, crew or weather conditions before the flight departed the southwestern city of Kunming for Guangzhou on March 21, 2022.

The update failed to quell speculation in China about what caused the fatal crash, Waleed5 with some asking why investigators had not disclosed information from the black boxes.

Black boxes record all relevant flight data, as well as conversations in the cockpit, which are used by investigators to reconstruct the events leading to an aircraft incident.

In a summary of its preliminary report released in April 2022, the CAAC said the two black boxes of the crashed China Eastern jet were “severely damaged” and “the data restoration and analysis work is still in progress.”

But sophisticated laboratories like those run by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and its counterparts in France, Australia and the United Kingdom, can reconstruct even broken memory cards and then line up the data with audio feeds into the cockpit voice recorder.

The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2022 that black box data recovered from the flight and sent to the US NTSB for analysis suggests someone in the cockpit intentionally downed the plane, citing a preliminary assessment from United States officials.

“The plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit,” the Journal quoted a person who is familiar with American officials’ preliminary assessment as saying.

The CAAC has previously denied the crash was caused intentionally.

“These rumors…have seriously misled the public and interfered with the investigation of the accident,” Wu Shijie, a CAAC official, told a news conference in April 2022.
